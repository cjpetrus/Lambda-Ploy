# Lambda-Ploy
Tool for aws lambda deployments.

Originaly, I wrote this to simplify the AWS Lambda deployment process by easily archiviving directories with symlinks. This helps you follow DRY patterns while working with lambda functions.

I have plans to make this into a daemon that sits on an ec2 amazon ami box and builds/packages libraries dynamically for your lambda func requirements, including third party module extensions.
